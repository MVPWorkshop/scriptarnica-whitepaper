== Welcome

Technology has advanced over the years and it has changed the way we live,
communicate, the way we travel and learn. Almost everything we use
has been elevated to better standards over the last decades through innovation. As peopleâ€™s habits and lifestyles change, the demand for advancing the type of technology we use gets higher.

That wave of technological improvements has affected almost every industry,
even the most traditional ones. The book industry is no exception, which is reflected in the rise in e-book usage. 

Only 15 years ago, the biggest publishers were saying that people will 
never read off screens. Just a few years later, when Amazon released
the Kindle, everything changed. 

We envision a simplified publishing process, which helps both indie writers
and publishing agencies, involves readers and their feedback even in the
very process of writing, incentivizes improved content with easy versioning,
and rewards all contributors through a decentralized e-book platform, 
called Scriptarnica.
